/**
 * Payment Routes - Razorpay Payment Gateway Integration
 * 
 * These routes handle the Zomato-style payment flow:
 * 1. Customer scans QR → opens /pay/:billId page
 * 2. Frontend calls POST /api/payments/create-order/:billId
 * 3. Backend creates Razorpay order and returns order_id + key
 * 4. Frontend opens Razorpay Checkout (UPI only)
 * 5. Customer completes UPI payment
 * 6. Frontend receives success → calls POST /api/payments/verify
 * 7. Webhook (payment.captured) also confirms payment
 * 8. Bill is marked PAID and receipt is generated
 * 
 * SECURITY NOTES:
 * - create-order endpoint is PUBLIC (no auth) since customers scanning QR aren't logged in
 * - However, it only creates orders for existing bills (which were created by authenticated merchants)
 * - verify endpoint validates Razorpay signature using HMAC-SHA256 and finalizes the bill
 * - Webhook endpoint uses raw body parser for signature verification
 * - Either a verified signature OR the webhook finalizes the bill; receipt creation is
 *   idempotent (unique billId) so whichever arrives second is a no-op
 */

// PUBLIC ROUTES (No Auth Required)
// These are called by the payment page after QR scan
